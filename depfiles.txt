# depfiles file format

depfiles are useful for dynamic build deps

good to use an existing format, has the advantage of Just Working with make,
the most common build system

documents a lowest common feature set that tools reading dep files should have

gcc's -MMD output matches this (except for bugs in some gccs)

should cover:
* \ and $ escaping
* spaces in filenames
* slashes vs backslashes in paths
* file case in paths (use native case)
* some gccs might list .o file twice
* multi-output files should at least error in a sane way?
* no tabs for continuation lines (else make thinks it's a command) (?)

omitted but interesting for v2:
* require multiple output lines to be separated by completely empty lines?
* multiple outputs per depfile (needed for ocaml i think)
