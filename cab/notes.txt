lz77 encoding:
- for vanilla lz77, greedy is optimal (but slow)
- "lazy" (delay committing match until checking if longer match exists at
  next pos) is a bit slower but better
- in practice, hash chains are fast and ok (and is what e.g. gzip default uses)
- lzss paper has "optimal parse" but that's no longer optimal when state like
  e.g. lzx's "reuse last match" is used
